# Decision-Tree-Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning project where I implement a Decision Tree classifier. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation of the model's performance.

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify patients at risk of heart disease using a Decision Tree model. The key steps in building this machine learning model include:

- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values and feature encoding.
- **Training the Decision Tree classifier**.
- **Model evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Files in the Repository

- **Heart.csv**: The dataset used for training the model.
- **DecisionTree.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the Decision Tree model.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
